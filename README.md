### Hello there! 👋

Welcome to my project playground.

I am an entrepreneur, engineer, and founder focused on bringing rad SaaS startups to market. At heart, I am a builder and tinkerer, and a passionate believer in product and team as the core pillars of a successful venture. I have been an advisor to more than a dozen organizations and acted in a consulting capacity with dozens of startups and technology companies across the consumer, healthcare, human insights, productivity, and education markets.

I co-founded and lead product and technology at [Our Wave](https://www.ourwave.org).

I'm currently heads down on a new stealth venture - more to come soon! 🤫
